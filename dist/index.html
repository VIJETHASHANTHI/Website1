                    <p>
                        There is no dearth of guided meditation techniques on the market today. What makes Isha Kriya
                        special is its simplicity and effectiveness. It does not require you to sit through a program
                        to learn it, but can be taught to anyone, by anyone, anywhere, in a short time. 12 to 18
                        minutes of practice per day is all it takes to bring a profound transformation in your life.


                    </p>
                    <p>"Meditation" or "Dhyana" means to go beyond the limitations of the physical body and the mind.
                        Only when you transcend the limited perspective of the body and the mind do you have a complete
                        dimension of life within you.</p>
